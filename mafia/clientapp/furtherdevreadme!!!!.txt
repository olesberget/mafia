## Future Development Notes

- **React Integration**: When beginning to integrate or transition to React for frontend development, 
remember to add the proxy setting in the `package.json` of the React app to handle API requests to the ASP.NET backend.

When we are ready to implement state management, we must create a redux store and provide it at the top level of our react application.
